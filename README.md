### Hey, I'm Rafa from Alella (Barcelona)
I am a Sr Engineering Director at Glovo, leading the Logistics, Vendor, and Ads organizations.

- I enjoy creating a good working atmosphere for the teams, so expect me to crack jokes sometimes (even bad ones).
- I used to be a backend engineer, and I am into software engineering and architecture topics.
- I mostly read code here on GitHub, which is why my contributions are sporadic.
- I am endlessly curious, with my current learning focus being Data Science.
- In my spare time, I spend time with my family, play padel, and hike a lot.
