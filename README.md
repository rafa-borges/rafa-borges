### Hey, I'm Rafa from Alella (Barcelona)

I am an Engineering Director at Glovo leading the Customer Growth cluster.

- We are currently building a whole set of new features to increase the reach of the Glovo app
- I enjoy creating a good working atmosphere for the team so expect me cracking jokes every now and then (yes even bad ones)
- I used to be a backend engineer, so I am still into software engineering and architecture topics
- I am hiring and building new teams in Barcelona and Warsaw so contact me if you are interest in joining Glovo
- I mostly read code here in GitHub, that is why my contributions are sporadic
- On my spare time, besides playing padel, I am learning Swift just because it is fun
