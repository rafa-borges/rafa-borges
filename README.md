### Hey, I'm Rafa from Alella (Barcelona)

I am an Engineering Director at Glovo leading the Logistics, Vendor and Ads organizations.

- I enjoy creating a good working atmosphere for the teams so expect me cracking jokes sometimes (even bad ones)
- I used to be a backend engineer, and I am into software engineering and architecture topics
- I mostly read code here in GitHub, that is why my contributions are sporadic
- On my spare time, besides playing padel, I am learning Swift and TypeScript just because it is fun
